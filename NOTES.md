My main intetion was to crete a Discount interface ( coding to interface ) which would be implemented by different discount classes using different discount logics

If I had more time I would have worked out improvements on the logic for the 'BuyOneKileForHalfPriceDiscount' and 'BuyTwoForOnePoundDiscount'.
